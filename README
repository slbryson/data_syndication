The code in this repo are primarily iPython notebooks for further filtering of CDMA PCMD
files after being processed by the Network Coverage Visualization tool.  While ultimately
direct filtering of RAW PCMD records is desired so that the analyst can examine different
relationships with data this is a pre-emptive step re-using the field mapping 
already performed by the NCV tool.
However, the tool still delivers a significant size report in terms of metadata to be processed.
Hence, the need for further manipulation to look for statistical outliers with respect
to a report that describes approximately 132 concurrent data points per connection that was 
ultimately classified as drop.  The goal is to extract the hidden relationships between the
data points of each drop such that a pattern for correction in the most effective way can
be perscribed.

There are several notebooks in the directory each with the same theme of taking tabular data 
and sorting and formulating it such that it can be visualized or correlated among columns

For CDMA the FullMarket notebook will process a complete market supplied data set from the
NCV Call Drop study output.  These files usually contain anywhere from 800K to 4.5M records (calls) from
a major metropolitan market.

There are other notebooks included that will process ill formed performance metric data from LTE
KPIs. These data sets are usually ill formed in terms of sorting by hour, day, cell and technology.  The
python scripts re-factor the data to a format that is used to determine relationships and
correlations.
